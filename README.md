# Outfit Orbit - Term Project
## Project Details 
### Project Description
Our project is Outfit Orbit, an attempt at allowing users to repurpose and restyle items they have in their wardrobe by offering both a virtual wardrobe representation, but also providing peronalized outfit recommendations based on their pieces. Users are able to sign in to have access to their wardrobe, and are easily able to add and remove pieces which are classified by various fields. Then, users are able to input a prompt for the description of their outfit, and a ChatGPT API call is made which returns an outfit created from the pieces in the wardrobe which matches the inputted description. This outfit is then displayed, and the user has the opportunity to "like" the outfit, which allocates each of the clothing items a point. These points are taken into account when generating outfits, prioritizing pieces with a lower point value to encourage users to use their closet in its entirety and venture out from their most worn pieces.
